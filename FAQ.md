| Is it possible to fork my repository into the Quantlet organization? | If you are a [member of the Quantlet organization](https://github.com/orgs/QuantLet/people) you can fork public repositories from your personal account to the Quantlet organization, see [Submission Guideline for NON Members of the Quantlet organization](guidelines/Submission_Guide_GitHub_Non_Members.pdf). If you are not a member, ask your supervising Quantlet member to fork it for you. |
| What is the benefit of using YAML format? | If you format your "metainfo.txt" according to YAML, we are able to automatically create a Readme.md and add it to your repository. This saves you the time to do it by yourself. |
